# Keep learning project : AWS <!-- omit in toc -->
It is true that Cloud services are great tools and it can make your life easier as a devops engineer. I would like to understand the tools better and solve challanges in better way with it. AWS has lots of different services and releases new services and features continously. I made a resolution to keep learning AWS services by watching at least two re:invent youtube videos a week.

## AWS re:Invent 2018: Become an IAM Policy Master in 60 Minutes or Less

ðŸ¤”I can let each team leader assign policy to their team members with a permission boundaries and tag-based access control. 

- AWS Organizations(Service control policies), IAM(Permission policies and Permission boundaries), AWS STS(Scoped-down policies), Specific AWS services(Resource-based policies), VPC endpoints(Endpoint Policies) 
- **within an account**: Service control policies AND (IAM policies OR Resource-based policies) 
**across accounts**: Service control policies AND (IAM policies AND Resource-based policies)
- **Organization units**: You can use organizational units (OUs) to group accounts together to administer as a single unit. This greatly simplifies the management of your accounts. For example, you can attach a policy-based control to an OU, and all accounts within the OU automatically inherit the policy. You can create multiple OUs within a single organization, and you can create OUs within other OUs. Each OU can contain multiple accounts, and you can move accounts from one OU to another. 

### Permission bundaries <!-- omit in toc -->

create a region restricted policy \
arn:aws:iam:xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/region-restriction
```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "secretmanager:*",
        "lambda:*",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "aws:RequestedRegion": [
                "us-west-1",
                "us-west-2"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

create a policy to allow developers to create roles only with specific prefix name.
```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "iam:CreatePolicy",
        "iam:CreatePolicyVersion",
        "iam:DeletePolicyVersion"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/project-a-*"
}
```

set a permission boundary condition to allow developers to manage policies in the boundary.
```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/project-a-*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "iam:permissionBoundary": "arn:aws:iam:xxxxxxxxxxxx:policy/region-restriction"
        }
    }
}
```

### tag-based access control <!-- omit in toc -->

create a region restricted policy for developers
```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "ec2:RunInstances"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:subnet/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:key-pair/*",
        ...
    ],
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "aws:RequestedRegion": [
                "us-west-1",
                "us-west-2"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Allow for creation of tags when creating new resources
```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "ec2:CreateTags",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "ec2:CreateAction": "RunInstances"
        }
    }
}
```

force to set specific tags when developers create new resources
```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
    "Condition": {
        "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
            "aws:TagKeys": ["project", "name"]
        },
        "StringEquals": {
            "aws:RequestTag/project": ["dorky"],
            "aws:RequestedRegion": ["us-west-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
    }
}
```

control which existing resources and values developers can tag
```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "ec2:CreateTags",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "ec2:ResourceTag/project": ["dorky"]
        },
        "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
            "aws:TagKeys": ["project", "name"]
        },
        "StringEqualsIfExists": {
            "aws:RequestTag/project": ["dorky"]
        }
    }
}
```

Control resources users can manage based on tag values
```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "aws:ResourceTag/project": "dorky"
        }
    }
}
```

#### you can tag IAM users and roles <!-- omit in toc -->

You can tag IAM users for the project and change policies `"aws:RequestTag/project": ["dorky"]` to `"aws:RequestTag/project": ["${aws:PrincipalTag/project}"]!
